Module "MC"        (component Init_MC_HCS12Z)
   - MC_Init -This method initializes registers of the MC module according to this Peripheral Initialization settings. Call 
                this method in the user code to initialize the module. By default, the method is called by PE automatically; 
                see "Call Init method" property of the component for more details.

Module "Cpu"       (component MC9S12ZVHL64_100)
   - Cpu_EnableInt -Enable maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_DisableInt -Disable maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_SetWaitMode -Set low power mode - Wait mode.   For more information about the wait mode see documentation of this CPU. 
                Release from Wait mode: Reset or interrupt
   - Cpu_SetStopMode -Set low power mode - Stop mode.   For more information about the stop mode see documentation of this CPU.
   - Cpu_Delay100US -This method realizes software delay. The length of delay is at least 100 microsecond multiply input 
                parameter [us100]. As the delay implementation is not based on real clock, the delay time may be increased by 
                interrupt service routines processed during the delay. The method is independent on selected speed mode.
